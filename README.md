PROBLEM STATEMENT SIH1322 Domestic Waste Management Clean & Green Technology Software Improper waste disposal not only contributes to environmental pollution but also affects the overall cleanliness and hygiene of a neighborhood. The challenge is to develop innovative solutions that address the specific issue of neighbors disposing of waste bags irresponsibly, causing litter and unsightly conditions. Participants are encouraged to propose and implement ideas that tackle this challenge and promote responsible waste management practices within the community. The solutions should focus on: Awareness and Education: Develop educational campaigns or initiatives to raise awareness among neighbors about the importance of proper waste disposal. This can include distributing informative materials, organizing community workshops, or leveraging digital platforms to educate residents about waste management best practices. Behavioral Change: Design strategies to encourage neighbors to adopt responsible waste disposal habits. This can involve implementing incentive programs, creating friendly competitions, or establishing neighborhood agreements that promote and reward responsible waste management behaviors. Community Engagement: Foster a sense of community ownership by engaging residents in waste management activities. This can involve organizing neighborhood clean-up drives, establishing community composting initiatives, or facilitating recycling programs to encourage active participation and responsibility among neighbors. Infrastructure Improvement: Propose solutions that address the lack of proper waste management infrastructure in the neighborhood. This can include advocating for the installation of additional waste bins, implementing a neighborhood waste collection system, or collaborating with local authorities to improve waste disposal facilities. Technology and Innovation: Leverage technology to support responsible waste management practices. This can involve developing mobile applications for waste collection scheduling and reminders, implementing smart waste bins with sensors and monitoring capabilities, or using blockchain technology to track and incentivize proper waste disposal. By addressing these aspects, the proposed solutions will contribute to overcoming the challenge of neighbors disposing of waste bags irresponsibly and promoting a cleaner, more sustainable neighborhood. The solutions should be practical, scalable, and feasible to implement within a residential community, fostering positive behavioral changes and encouraging a collective effort toward responsible waste management.
